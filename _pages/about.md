Hello World!
I am currently PhD student in neuroscience at Paris Brain Institute. My research interest include diffusion MRI (dMRI), tractography, machine learning, basal ganglia, deep brain stimulation (DBS).
I am highly interested to understand what kind of anatomo-functional organisation that we can observe in basal ganglia via in vivo dMRI and how these organizations could help to predict better individual targeting in DBS surgery.
